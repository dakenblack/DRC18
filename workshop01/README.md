# OpenCV workshop 01
This repo contains all relevant material used in the workshop.

## Inside
The Tutorials here go through the following methods/topics
* loading and displaying an iamge
* the way images are stored in OpenCV
* basic thresholding
* Convolution + Gaussian blurring
* Canny edge filtering + double thresholding
* HoughLines
* finding appropriate threshold values with MATLAB

## Outside
The following topics were not convered in the materials, but would be good material to go to next after getting familiar with these tutorials
* Adaptive thresholding
* Erode/Dilate
* Noise Removal by median filtering (very similar to erode/dilate)
* findContours
* LUV colour spaces and others
