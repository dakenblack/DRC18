# README
This directory will have some helpful jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a very common data science tool used by a lot of people. It's web based so there's not much to install. 
## Prereq
* python3
* all python packages from requirements.txt
* virtualenv (optional)
    you can make custom environments to develop in
    there's no need to install all python packages to your system directories (some packages might be dodgy)
